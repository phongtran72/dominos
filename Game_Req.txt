1. Setting
One standard double-six domino set (28 tiles).
Two players.

2. Objective
The first player to reach 100 points wins the match.
Points accumulate across multiple hands.

3. The Deal

Shuffle all 28 tiles face down.
Deal 14 tiles to each player.
There is no boneyard.
Players keep their tiles concealed.


4. Determining the Lead
First Hand
The human player chooses who leads.
Subsequent Hands
The winner of the previous hand leads the next hand.

5. Gameplay

5.1 Opening Play
The leader may play any tile.

5.2 Matching

Players alternate turns.
A tile must match one of the two open ends of the layout.
Standard domino orientation rules apply.
Only two open ends exist at all times.
If a tile can be played on either end, the player must choose which end.

5.3 Mandatory Play

If a player has at least one legal move, they must play.
A player may pass only if they have zero legal moves.

6. End of Hand

A hand ends in one of two ways: Domino or Block.
6.1 Domino
A hand ends by Domino when:

A player plays their final tile.
That player has no tiles remaining.

The hand ends immediately upon placement.









6.2 Block





A hand ends by Block when:



Neither player has a legal move, and
At least one player still has tiles remaining.




A Block may occur in two forms:





Immediate Lock





A player places a tile and, immediately after placement, neither player has a legal move.





Confirmed Lock (Pass–Pass)





A player has no legal move and passes.

The opponent also has no legal move and passes.

The board is locked and the hand ends.









7. The Ghost 13 Rule (0–0)







7.1 Normal Value





The [0–0] tile is worth 0 pips if:



It is playable at the end of the hand, or
It has already been played on the board.






7.2 Dead Condition





At the end of the hand, if:



The [0–0] tile remains in a player’s hand, and
All 6 other zero-suit tiles ([0–1] through [0–6]) are on the final board layout,




Then it becomes 13 pips for scoring purposes.



Dead status is determined strictly by board state.









8. Determining the Aggressor (Block Only)





If the hand ends by Block, an Aggressor must be identified.









8.1 Puppeteer Rule (Highest Priority)





A player is the Aggressor if:



They play a tile.
Their opponent has exactly one legal tile.
The opponent must play it (mandatory play).
Every legal placement of that tile results in a blocked board.




If the opponent’s forced move produces the block, the previous player is the Aggressor.









8.2 Direct Block





If the Puppeteer rule does not apply:



The Aggressor is the player who made the most recent tile placement before the board became locked.



Every Block has exactly one Aggressor.
